# ME 539 -  Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning

This repository includes the source code for the course "ME 539 Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning," which is being taught during Fall 2023 by Prof. [Ilias Bilionis](https://www.predictivesciencelab.org) at Purdue University.
The in-person version of the course meets every Tuesday and Thursday 12:00-1:15 pm at ARMS B071.
Please only come to the room if registered, as there is insufficient physical space.
There is also a Purdue online version of the class and an [EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PurdueX+ME597x+2T2020/course/) version.

There are pre-recorded videos of all lectures.
These are accessible to Purdue students through [Brightspace](https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/login).
EdX students will find the same videos in EdX.
More details about the syllabus and course evaluations are available on the corresponding websites.
