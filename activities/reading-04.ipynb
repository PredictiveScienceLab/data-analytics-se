    "# Reading Activity 4: Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To introduce continuous random variables.\n",
    "+ To introduce the cumulative distribution function and its properties.\n",
    "+ To introduce the probability density function and its properties.\n",
    "+ To introduce the expectation of continuous random variables.\n",

    "## Something more on probability spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that when $\\Omega$ is a continuous space, like $\\mathbb{R}$ for example, it is not possible to take $\\mathcal{F}$ to be all the subsets of $\\Omega$ (you need to take a measure-theoretic probability theory class to understand why this is).\n",
    "However, many \"nice\" subsets of $\\Omega$ are usually in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For example, in the case of $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathcal{F}$ can include all intervals, and any countable unions and intersections of intervals.\n",
    "That's a lot of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, $\\mathcal{F}$ must satisfy certain properties for everything to be well-defined.\n",
    "These properties are:\n",
    "+ $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "+ For any $A$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, the complement $A^c$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "+ For any $A_1,A_2,\\dots$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, the union $\\cup_n A_n$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "When a set of subsets $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies these properties, we say that it forms a $\\sigma$-algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$.\n",
    "A continuous random variable models the result of an experiment that can potentially take infinitely many values.\n",
    "That is, it is a function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a continuous random variable.\n",
    "Its cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_X(x)$ gives the probability that $X$ is smaller than $x$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_X(x) := \\mathbb{P}(X\\le x) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\left\\{\\omega: X(\\omega) \\le x\\right\\}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $F_X(x)$ is an increasing function.\n",
    "+ $F_X(-\\infty) = 0$.\n",
    "+ $F_X(+\\infty) = 1$.\n",
    "+ $\\mathbb{P}(a\\le X \\le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The probability density function\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) is a \"function\" $f_X(x)$ that can give us the probability that $X$ is in any \"good\" subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{P}(X\\in A) = \\int_A f_X(x) dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note that certain random variables may not have a PDF that is a function.\n",
    "That's why I put the word \"function\" in quotes.\n",
    "However, if you allow the PDF to include Dirac's $\\delta$, then any random variable has a PDF.\n",
    "We will ignore this complication for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will simplify the notation and we will be writing:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) \\equiv f_X(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "when there is no ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the probability density function\n",
    "+ $p(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$.\n",
    "+ $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) dx = 1$.\n",
    "+ The derivative of the CDF is the PDF, i.e., $F_X'(x) = p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations of continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of a continuous random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Its properties are the same as the expectation of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation of a function of the random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[f(X)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It satisfies the same properties as the expectation of discrete random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance of continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a continuous random variable is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{V}[X] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X-\\mathbb{E}[X]\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 p(x)dx.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It satisfies the same properties as the expectaiton of discrete andom variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dirac's delta and a unified view of all random variables (advaned)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac's $\\delta$ is a special function, actually called a distribution, which is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta(x) = 0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for $x\\not=0$, and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\delta(x) dx = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "You can think of Dirac's $\\delta$ as the PDF of a discrete random variable that takes the value $0$ with probability one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Dirac's $\\delta$ you can make any discrete random variable you want look like a continuous random variable.\n",
    "For example, consider a Categorical random variable taking values $x_1,\\dots,x_K$ with probabilities $p_1,\\dots,p_K$.\n",
    "The PDF of this random variable can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k\\delta(x - x_k).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general random variable one can think of has a PDF that consists of two parts:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = f^n_X(x) + f^{\\delta}_X(x),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a part $f^n_X(x)$ that is a nice proper function and a part $f^{\\delta}_X(x)$ that consists of a weighted sum of Dirac $\\delta$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, using the Dirac $\\delta$ trick we introduced above, there is no need to differentiate between integrations and summations.\n",
    "We can use integration for both continuous and discrete random variables."
