    "# Reading Activity 2: Basics of Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To understand the interprtation of probability theory as a representation of our state of knowledge.\n",
    "+ To learn about the common sense assumptions that give rise to the basic probability rules.\n",
    "+ To gain experience with the basic probability rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [Chapters 1 and 2, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, E. T. Jaynes](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability as a representation of our state of knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call $I$ all the *information* you have a this given moment.\n",
    "And I am talking about absolutely everything: what your parents taught you, what you learned in school, what you learned in college, what your eyes see right now on some scientific instruments.\n",
    "Now consider a, well-defined, sentence $A$ that says something about the world.\n",
    "For example, $A$ could be \"The result of the next coin toss John performs will be heads.\"\n",
    "Or anything really.\n",
    "We want a technical machinery that can turn all the information $I$ we have into a real number that tells us how plausible it is that $A$ is true.\n",
    "This is what probability theory does.\n",
    "It gives us such a number.\n",
    "Call it $p(A|I)$ and read it as \"the probability that $A$ is true given that we know $I$.\"\n",
    "So, probability theory is an attempt to represent our state of knowledge about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But what about frequencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "In introductory courses to probability or statistics, we usually learn that the probability of an event is the frequency with each it occurs in nature.\n",
    "This is absolutely fine if the event is something that indeed occurs repeatedly.\n",
    "However, this intrepretation is quite restrictive.\n",
    "In particular, what can we say about an event that can happen only once?\n",
    "This interpretation forbids the quantification of epistemic uncertainties.\n",
    "We will expand the interpretation of probability.\n",
    "It can be shown, see E. T. Jaynes book for the proof, that this interpretation is compatible with the frequency interpretation.\n",
    "That is, when events occur repeatedly then the probabilities do become frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The common sense assumptions that give rise to the basic probability rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation. Pierre-Simon Laplace, Théorie analytique des probabilités (1814)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following three ingedients:\n",
    "+ A: a logical sentence\n",
    "+ B: another logical sentence\n",
    "+ I: all the information we know\n",
    "\n",
    "No other restriction apart that A and B are not contradictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a bit of notation so that we write less math:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $\\text{not}\\;A \\equiv \\neg A$\n",
    "+ $A\\;\\text{and}\\;B \\equiv A, B \\equiv AB$\n",
    "+ $A\\;\\text{or}\\;B \\equiv A+B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try to make a robot that can argue under uncertainty.\n",
    "It should be able to take logical sentences (such as $A$ and $B$ above) and argue about them using all the information it has.\n",
    "What sort of system should govern this robot.\n",
    "The following desiderata seem reasonable:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.\n",
    "+ The system should have a qualitative correspondence to common sense.\n",
    "+ The system should be consistence in the sense that:\n",
    "   - If a conclusion can be reached in two ways, each way must lead to the same result.\n",
    "   - All evidence relevant to a question should be taken into account.\n",
    "   - Equivalent states of knowledge must be represented by equivalent plausibility assignments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "[Cox's theorem](www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X03000513?via=ihub) shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The desiderata are enough derive the rules of probability theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Talking about probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "We read $p(A|BI)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ the probability of A being true given that we know that B and I are true; or\n",
    "+ the probability of A being true given that we know that B is true; or\n",
    "+ the probability of A given B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpratation of probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $p(A|BI)$ is a number between 0 and 1 quantifying the degree of plausibility that A is true given B and I.\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = 1$ when we are certain that A is true if B is true (and I).\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = 0$ when we are certain that A is false if B is true (and I).\n",
    "+ $0< p(A|B,I) < 1$ when we are uncertain about A if B is true (and I).\n",
    "+ $p(A|B,I) = \\frac{1}{2}$ when we are completely ignorant about A if B is true (and I).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The rules of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two rules of probability from which everything else can be derived.\n",
    "These are direct consequencies of the desiderate and Cox's theorem.\n",
    "They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The **obvious rule**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A|I) + p(\\neg A|I) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The sum rule is obvious. It states that either $A$ or its negation $\\neg A$ must be true.\n",
    "(It is vitally important that you do not try to apply probability in a system that includes contradictions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The **product rule** (or Bayes' rule or Bayes' theorem):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A,B|I) = p(A|B,I)p(B|I).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The product rule is not obvious.\n",
    "Understanding it requires a bit of meditation.\n",
    "It states that the probability of A and B is the probability of A given that B is true times the probability that B is true.\n",
    "Even though the correspondance is not one to one, visualizing events using the Venn diagrams helps in understanding the product rule:\n",
    "![Venn diagram](venn.png)\n",
    "In this diagram:\n",
    "    - $p(A,B|I)$ corresponds to the brown area (normalized by the area of I).\n",
    "    - $p(B|I)$ is the area of $B$ (normalized by the area of I).\n",
    "    - $p(A|BI)$ is the brown area (normalized by the area of B)."

    "+ This means that this particular red ball was not picked in the first draw.\n",
    "+ So, it is as if in the first draw you had one less red to worry about which increases the probability of a blue.\n",
    "+ So, it is as if you had 5 red balls and 4 blue balls giving you a probability of blue $\\frac{4}{9}\\approx 0.44$.\n",

    "It agrees perfectly with the prediction of the product rule.\n",
    "This was one of our desiderata (if you compute something in two different ways you should get the same result).\n",
    "You can rest assured that as soon as you use the product rule and the sum rule and logic, it is impossible to get the wrong answer.\n",
    "That is, if you can actually carry out the computations."
