    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To propagate uncertainties through an ordinary differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertainty propagation through an ordinary differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are commonly used to model the response of physical systems.\n",
    "Very often, one may be uncertain about the parameters of these ODEs, e.g., physical constants, or even their initial conditions.\n",
    "The question is how does this uncertainty affect the quantity predicted by the ODE?\n",
    "How can you mathematically describe this effect, how can you estimate it, and how can you visualize it?\n",
    "We are going to address these three questions using the a very simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential decay differential equation and its solution\n",
    "Consider the prototypical ODE describing the exponential decay of a quantity $y$ over time:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\dot{y} = \\frac{d y}{dt} =-ay(t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The equation says that the quantity $y$ is decreasing at a rate proportional to itself.\n",
    "The rate $a$ is the positive variable known as the *exponential decay constant* or *exponential decay rate*.\n",
    "The exponential decay rate has units of inverse time and it corresponds to the rate with which a unit of $y$ is lost per unit of time. The larger the exponential decay, the faster $y$ dies out over time.\n",
    "This equation has a plethora of possible interpretations ranging from chemical reactions to electrostatics to heat transfer to radioactivity to thermoelectricity to vibrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the equation, we also need *initial conditions*, basically how much $y$ we have at time $t=0$, i.e.,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(0) = y_0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The ODE with the initial conditions is called an *initial value problem* (IVP).\n",
    "For this particular equation, the solution of the initial value problem is analytically available:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = y_0e^{-at}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning random variables to uncertaint quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we are uncertain about the decay rate coefficient and the initial conditions.\n",
    "To model this, we are going to turn both these parameters into random variables.\n",
    "To do this, we are going to write down everything we know about these parameters and then pick compatible probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the decay rate.\n",
    "We know that it has to be positive.\n",
    "We have to assign to $a$ a probability distribution with positive support, i.e., a probability distribution that puts zero probability on values that are not positive.\n",
    "Two of the most commonly used probability distributions are the [Exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) and the [Log-Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution).\n",
    "Which one should we pick?\n",
    "It depends on what we know about it.\n",
    "Let's say that we expect it to be around $0.1$ (units of inverse time) and that's all we know.\n",
    "Mathematically, this means that we want the expectation of $a$ to be:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[a] = 0.1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If that's all you know then the legitimate thing to do is to assign to $a$ an Exponential distribution with a rate parameter that gives you the right expectation.\n",
    "Why is this the legitimate thing to do?\n",
    "Well, that's a big topic which we are going to discuss at a later lecture when we talk about the [principle of maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy).\n",
    "The short answer is that *the Exponential is the least biased distribution with positive support and a known expectation*.\n",
    "Mathematically, we write:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a\\sim \\operatorname{Exp}(\\lambda),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and we need to pick $\\lambda$ so that $\\mathbb{E}[a] = \\lambda^{-1} = 0.1$.\n",
    "So, we have to pick $\\lambda = 10$.\n",
