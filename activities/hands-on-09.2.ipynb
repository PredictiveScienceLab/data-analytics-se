    "+ Experiment with the number of bins $M$. Repeat the code above with $M=5, 10$ and $1000$. What do you observe? What happens when you have to few bins? What happens when you have to many bins? You should pick the number of bins and $N$ together. As a rule of thumb $N$ should be about ten times $M$. For a given choice of $M$, it is possible to pick how many $N$'s you need using what we will learn in lecture 10."
