    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensionality reduction problem is as follows.\n",
    "You have many observations $\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}$.\n",
    "Each observation $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is a high-dimensional vector, say $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ with $D\\gg 1$.\n",
    "What you would like to do is describe this dataset with a smaller number of dimensions without losing too much information.\n",
    "You would like to project each of the $\\mathbf{x}_i$'s to $d$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{z}_i$ with $d \\ll D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you like to do dimensionality reduction?\n",
    "First, you can take any dataset, no matter how high-dimensional, and visualize it in two dimensions. This may help develop intuition about this dataset.\n",
    "Second, once you project the high-dimensional dataset to lower dimensions, it is often easier to carry out unsupervised tasks like clustering or density estimation.\n",
    "Third, supervised tasks involving high-dimensional data become more manageable if you reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to do regression between the high-dimensional $\\mathbf{x}$ and a scalar quantity $y$. In that case, it will probably pay off if you first reduce the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{x}$ by projecting it to a lower-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{z}$ and then do regression between $\\mathbf{z}$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dozens of dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
    "See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction#:~:text=Dimensionality%20reduction%2C%20or%20dimension%20reduction,close%20to%20its%20intrinsic%20dimension.) for an incomplete list.\n",
    "In this lecture, we will develop the simplest and the most widely used dimensionality reduction technique: Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "If you want to read about it independently, I suggest [Chapter 12.1-2, Bishop (2006)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732)."

    "## Why is Dimensionality Reduction Possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are taking a picture of your head.\n",
    "Each picture is a high-dimensional object.\n",
    "For example, if you take a picture with a 10-megapixel camera, then each image is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{10^7}$.\n",
    "Suppose you generate a dataset of such pictures with the same background, lighting, and facial expression.\n",
    "All you do is change the angle of the camera.\n",
    "Then, you can describe this dataset with much smaller dimensions.\n",
    "All you need to know is where and how the camera is oriented.\n",
    "So, you can get away with six dimensions: three for the camera position and three for the camera's orientation.\n",
    "We went from $\\mathbb{R}^{10^7}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^6$.\n",
    "The dataset you generated is a 6-dimensional manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{10^7}$.\n",
    "It is a curved surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{10^7}$.\n",
    "This is the intuition behind dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "Now you can imagine varying things: the background, the lighting, the facial expression, the hairstyle, the clothes, etc.\n",
    "This increases the dimensions you need to describe the dataset, but it remains much smaller than $\\mathbb{R}^{10^7}$.\n"
