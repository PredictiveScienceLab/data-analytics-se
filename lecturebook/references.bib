   abstract = {The numerical calculation of the electromagnetic fields within a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is sensitive to the magnetic characteristic of steel and permanent magnets. The objective of this work is to quantify the impact of magnetization curve uncertainties on the performance of a PMSM and its drive system. Our approach is as follows. First, we construct stochastic models that reflect the uncertainties in B-H curves and PM remanent flux density. Second, to overcome the computational limitations of finite element analysis, we replace it with surrogate models based on Gaussian process regression. Third, we perform uncertainty propagation studies to assess the combined effect of steel and PM uncertainties on the maximum average torque vs. speed characteristics and the minimum dc-link voltage.},

   abstract = {The objective of this article is to set forth a computationally efficient methodology to quantify the effects and assess the relevance of geometric and material uncertainty on a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), based on a nonlinear finite-element model (FEM). Our methodology follows the theory of Gaussian process regression and principal component analysis to build a computationally inexpensive surrogate model that replaces the FEM. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis studies focus on the electromagnetic torque, flux linkage, and core loss of the PMSM.},

A total of 100 stress-strain curves for uniaxial tension specimens and 54 stress-strain curves for plane strain tension specimens are shared. Strains are estimated through digital image correlation using a 50.8 mm (2 inch) gauge length for the uniaxial tension specimens and a 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) gauge length for the plane strain specimens. The strains are an average of several measurements (at approximately 350-μm intervals) across the width of the gauge section.}

abstract = {The reaction pathways that lead to the formation of intermediates and final products of the reduction of nitrate on tin at high overpotential were studied in this paper. Possible chemical or electrochemical reactions of the intermediates were investigated and discussed. A complex mechanistic scheme was proposed which describes the formation of all products apart from nitrogen, even though the latter is the main electrolysis product. Several simplified reaction schemes were investigated and each fitted to experimental data using a Bayesian approach. It was concluded that in order to describe the rate of nitrogen formation, another intermediate must be considered between nitrite and nitrogen. It is finally postulated that this intermediate is nitramide; however, further work in order to develop a method for determining the nitramide concentration is required to confirm that this is indeed the precursor of nitrogen.}

The theorem states that any system for plausible reasoning that satisfies certain qualitative requirements intended to ensure consistency with classical deductive logic and correspondence with commonsense reasoning is isomorphic to probability theory. However, the requirements used to obtain this result have been the subject of much debate. We review Cox’s theorem, discussing its requirements, the intuition and reasoning behind these, and the most important objections, and finish with an abbreviated proof of the theorem.}
