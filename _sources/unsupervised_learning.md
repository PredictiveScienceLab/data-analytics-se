# Unsupervised Learning

In this chapter, we discuss unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, you are given a bunch of data and you have to find some structure in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning that we are going to cover include clustering (separating the data into groups), density estimation (learn how to sample from the same distribution that generated the data in the first place), and dimensionality reduction (explain a high-dimensional dataset using a small number of dimensions).
