    "For example, \"the circumference of the Earth is 40,075 km (plus or minus 1 km)\" is a logical sentence.\n",
    "We will not go any deeper into the formal definition of logical sentences.\n",

    "We will denote logical sentences with capital letters: $A$, $B$, $C$, etc.\n",
    "We form new logical sentences from old ones using the following logical connectives:\n",

    "+ What your eyes see right now on some scientific instruments.\n",
    "\n",

    "Or anything.\n",
    "We are uncertain about $A$.\n",
    "We do not know if it is true or false.\n",
    "We could use the information $ I $ to say something more about $ A $.\n",
    "Maybe we believe that it is more likely that $A$ is true than false.\n",
    "Maybe the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is about this problem.\n",
    "It gives us a number $p(A|I)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In introductory courses to probability or statistics, we usually learn that the probability of an event is the frequency with which it occurs in nature.\n",
    "This interpretation is valid if the event is something that indeed occurs repeatedly.\n",
    "However, it is pretty restrictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, what can we say about an event that can happen only once?\n",
    "For example, what is the probability that life on Earth will end in a billion years?\n",
    "It is not possible to repeat this experiment.\n",
    "It is not even possible to observe its outcome.\n",
    "The frequency interpretation of probability is not applicable.\n",
    "However, we would like to use probability to quantify our degree of belief that life on Earth will end in a billion years.\n",
    "It makes intuitive sense that we can do this.\n",
    "We want to do this.\n",
    "Scientists and engineers think like this all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is our approach compatible with the frequency interpretation?\n",
    "It can be shown, see {cite}`jaynes03` for the proof, that our approach is indeed compatible with the frequency interpretation.\n",
    "That is, when events occur repeatedly, then the probabilities do become frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ The **obvious rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A|I) + p(\\neg A|I) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule states that $A$ or its negation must be true.\n",
    "We see why it is vitally important that you refrain from applying probability in a system that includes contradictions.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "p(A,B|I) = p(A|B,I)p(B|I).\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The rule states that the probability of $A$ and $B$ is the probability of $A$ given that $B$ is true times the probability that $B$ is true.\n",
