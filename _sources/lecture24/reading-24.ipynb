    "## Deep neural networks as universal function approximators\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks (DNN) are function approximators expressing hierarchically layered information. \n",
    "You can use DNNs to approximate a function of $d$ inputs to $q$ outputs using some parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "We, typicaly write $\\mathbf{y} = f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta)$.\n",
    "Here $f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta)$ is the DNN, and $\\theta$ are its parameters.\n",
    "We will clarify both these concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, deep neural networks are compositions of simpler one-layer neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta) = (f_L \\circ f_{L-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1)( \\mathbf{x}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest setting, the layers $f_l$s are a composition of an elementwise nonlinearity with a linear transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_i ( \\mathbf{z} ) = h^{(i)} ( \\mathbf{W}^{(i)} \\mathbf{z} + \\mathbf{b}^{(i)}  ),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\mathbf{W}^{(i)}$ is a matrix of parameters, $\\mathbf{b}^{(i)}$ is a vector of parameters, and $h^{(i)}$ is a nonlinear function applied in an elementwise fashion (i.e., applied separately to each one of the inputs that are provided to it). A DNN with this structure is called a *fully-connected* DNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning terminology, the matrix $\\mathbf{W}^{(i)}$ is referred to as a *weight* matrix, the vector $\\mathbf{b}^{(i)}$ is referred to as a *bias*.\n",
    "The function $h^{(i)}(\\cdot)$ is called the *activation* function. It is typical for all but the last layer of a DNN to have the same activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the final layer, the output's dimensionality and the activation function's choice are dictated by constraints on the final output of the function $f$. For example:\n",
    "1. If the output from $f$ is a real number with no constraints, the output dimensions are $d_L=1$ and $h^{(L)}(\\mathbf{z}) = 1$.\n",
    "2. If the output from $f$ is a positive real, $n^{(L)} = q = 1$ and $\\sigma_L(x) = \\exp(x)$. \n",
    "3. If the output from $f$ is a probability mass function on $K$ categories, $n^{(L)} = q = K$ and $h^{(L)}(\\mathbf{z}) = \\frac{\\exp(z_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\exp(z_j)}, i=1, 2, \\dots, K$.\n",
    "Don't try to memorize this. We will revisit it in the following lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different ways of constructing the compositional structure of $f$ lead to different *architectures* such as fully connected networks (shown above), *recurrent neural networks*, *convolutional neural networks*, *autoencoders*, *residual networks*, etc."

    "### Universal theorem for neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The [universal approximation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) guarantees that DNNs are good function approximators.\n",
    "In plain English, the (original) theorem states that if you take any decent activation function and build a dense neural network with which you can approximate any continuous function (defined on a compact input domain) arbitrarily well, if you keep increasing the number of neurons you use.\n",
    "Recently, researchers have proven similar theorems for deep neural networks.\n",
    "In general, if you grow your network by adding neurons and layers, it can approximate almost anything you need.\n",
    "That's one of the reasons why deep neural networks have been (re)gaining momentum recently.\n",
