    "\n",
    "Remember that the sigmoid function takes the scalar $f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta)$ and maps it on $[0,1]$ so that we get a probability.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "p(y=0|\\mathbf{x},\\theta) = 1 - p(y=1|\\mathbf{x},\\theta) = 1 - \\operatorname{sigm}(f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta)).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for an arbitrary $y$ (either 0 or 1), we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(y|\\mathbf{x},\\theta) = \\left[\\operatorname{sigm}(f(\\mathbf{x};\\theta))\\right]^y\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a nice trick because it activates the right term based on what $y$ is.\n",

    "However, $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ is just a bunch of $K$ scalars.\n",

    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "DNNs are incredibly flexible. However, this makes them prone to overfitting.\n",
    "As we have discussed, one way to avoid overfitting is to add regularization to the loss function.\n",
    "This works as follows.\n",
    "Instead of minimizing $L(\\theta)$ you minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = L(\\theta) + \\lambda R(\\theta),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is a positive parameter, and $R(\\theta)$ is a term that penalizes very big weights.\n",
    "One possibility of $R(\\theta)$ is the L2 regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R(\\theta) = \\sum_j \\theta_j^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are many more.\n",
    "Also, you could add multiple regularizers - not just one.\n",
    "The bigger $\\lambda$ is, the more you regularize, and the smaller it is, the less you regularize.\n",
    "So, $\\lambda$ is a parameter you would like to tune - but more on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian interpretation of regularization\n",
    "As we showed during our regression lectures, the regularization can be interpreted as a maximum posterior approach to inference.\n",
    "To see this, assume that we have a data likelihood $p(y_{1:n}|\\mathbf{x}_{1:n},\\theta)$ for either a regression or a classification problem.\n",
    "Now, assume that you have a prior over all parameters, say $p(\\theta)$.\n",
    "Then, write down the posterior of the parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\theta|\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}, y_{1:n}) \\propto p(y_{1:n}|\\mathbf{x}_{1:n},\\theta)p(\\theta).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of picking the parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood, let's pick the parameters by maximizing the log posterior.\n",
    "This is equivalent to minimizing the following loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = -\\log p(y_{1:n}|\\mathbf{x}_{1:n},\\theta) - \\log p(\\theta).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the first term is just $L(\\theta)$.\n",
    "The second term is $\\lambda R(\\theta)$.\n",
    "For a more concrete example, assume that the prior over $\\theta$ is a zero-mean Gaussian with precision $\\alpha$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\theta) = N(\\theta|0, \\alpha^{-1}I).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\log p(\\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\sum_j\\theta_j^2 + \\text{const}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is how you get the L2 regularization term in a principled way."
