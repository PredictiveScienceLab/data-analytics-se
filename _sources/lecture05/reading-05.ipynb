    "Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "The *joint probability mass function* of the pair $(X,Y)$ is the function $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ giving the probability that $X=x$ and $Y=y$.\n",
    "Mathematically (and introducing a simplified notation), we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x,y) \\equiv p(X=x, Y=y) \\equiv f_{X,Y}(x,y) := \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\{\\omega: X(\\omega) = x, Y(\\omega)=y\\}\\right).\n",

    "\\sum_x \\sum_y p(x,y) = 1.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If you *marginalize* over the values of one of the random variables you get the pmf of the other.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before, we can marginalize over any subset of random variables to get the pmf of the remaining ones.\n",

    "## Joint probability density function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables.\n",
    "There joint probability density $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ is the function that can give us the probability that the pair $(X,Y)$ belongs to any \"good\" subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p\\left((X,Y)\\in A\\right) = \\int\\int_{A} f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy.\n",

    "when there is no ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you integrate one of the variables out of the joint, you get the PDF of the other variable.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x,y) dy,\n",

    "## Conditioning a random variable on another\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$.\n",

    "We will talk more about this in a later lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A usefull property of the covariance operator is that it can give tell you something about the variance of the sum of two random variables.\n",
    "It is:\n",
