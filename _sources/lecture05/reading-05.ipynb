    "The *joint probability mass function* of the pair $(X, Y)$ is the function $f_{X, Y}(x,y)$ giving the probability that $X=x$ and $Y=y$.\n",
    "Mathematically (and introducing a simplified notation), we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x,y) \\equiv p(X=x, Y=y) \\equiv f_{X,Y}(x,y) := p\\left(\\{\\omega: X(\\omega) = x, Y(\\omega)=y\\}\\right).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If you *marginalize* one of the random variables' values, you get the other's pmf.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\sum_y p(x,y),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Joint probability density function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables.\n",
    "Their joint probability density $f_{X, Y}(x,y)$ is the function that can give us the probability that the pair $(X, Y)$ belongs to any \"good\" subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "when there is no ambiguity.\n",

    "If you integrate one of the variables out of the joint, you get the PDF of the other variable.\n",

    "p(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x,y) dy,\n",

    "## Conditioning a random variable on another\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two random variables, $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "If we had observed that $Y=y$, how would this change the PDF of $X$?\n",
    "The answer is given via Bayes' rule.\n",
    "Recall Bayes' rule for two logical statements $A$ and $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(A|B) = \\frac{p(A,B)}{p(B)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct equation for the conditional probability, pick $A=(X=x)$ and $B=(Y=y)$.\n",
    "You get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x|y) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(y)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator is the joint PDF, and the denominator is the marginal PDF of $Y$.\n",
    "Since you can get the marginal PDF of $Y$ by integrating the joint PDF over $x$, you can also write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x|y) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x',y)dx'}.\n",

    "## The covariance operator\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance is the expectation of the product of the deviations of the random variables from their means.\n",
    "Let us try to understand this:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The product is positive if the two random variables move in the same direction.\n",
    "Think about it; when one is above its mean, the other is above its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The product is negative if the two random variables move in opposite directions.\n",
    "When one is above its mean, the other is below its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, we say that the two random variables are positively correlated; in the second case, we say they are negatively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the covariance operator\n",
    "The covariance operator has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is symmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{C}[X,Y] = \\mathbb{C}[Y,X].\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All these properties are easy to prove using the definition of the covariance operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another valuable property of the covariance operator is that it can tell you something about the variance of the sum of two random variables.\n",

    "Let's try to understand this result.\n",
    "The variance of the sum of two random variables is the sum of the variances plus a term that depends on the covariance.\n",

    "Here the two random variables tend to cancel each other out.\n",
    "If the two random variables are not correlated, then the covariance is zero, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The correlation coefficient\n",
    "The covariance of two random variables is not a very useful correlation measure because it depends on the units of the random variables.\n",
    "For example, if you measure a person's height in meters or feet, the covariance of the height and the weight of the person will be different.\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can define the correlation coefficient:\n",

    "The two random variables are not correlated if it is close to $0$.\n",
    "The correlation coefficient is unitless and a more useful measure of correlation.\n",
