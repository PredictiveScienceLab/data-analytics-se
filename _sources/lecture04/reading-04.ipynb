    "It turns out that when $\\Omega$ is a continuous space, like $\\mathbb{R}$ for example, it is not possible to take $\\mathcal{F}$ to be all the subsets of $\\Omega$ (you need to take a measure-theoretic probability theory class to understand why this is).\n",
    "However, many \"nice\" subsets of $\\Omega$ are usually in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For example, in the case of $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathcal{F}$ can include all intervals, and any countable unions and intersections of intervals.\n",
    "That's a lot of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, $\\mathcal{F}$ must satisfy certain properties for everything to be well-defined.\n",
    "These properties are:\n",
    "+ $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$\n",
    "+ For any $A$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, the complement $A^c$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "+ For any $A_1,A_2,\\dots$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, the union $\\cup_n A_n$ is in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "When a set of subsets $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies these properties, we say that it forms a $\\sigma$-algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$.\n",
    "A continuous random variable models the result of an experiment that can potentially take infinitely many values.\n",
    "That is, it is a function\n",

    "## The cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a continuous random variable.\n",
    "Its cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_X(x)$ gives the probability that $X$ is smaller than $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "## The probability density function\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) is a \"function\" $f_X(x)$ that can give us the probability that $X$ is in any \"good\" subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that certain random variables may not have a PDF that is a function.\n",
    "That's why I put the word \"function\" in quotes.\n",
    "However, if you allow the PDF to include Dirac's $\\delta$, then any random variable has a PDF.\n",
    "We will ignore this complication for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will simplify the notation and we will be writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) \\equiv f_X(x),\n",

    "+ $p(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$.\n",
    "+ $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) dx = 1$.\n",
    "+ The derivative of the CDF is the PDF, i.e., $F_X'(x) = p(x)$.\n",
