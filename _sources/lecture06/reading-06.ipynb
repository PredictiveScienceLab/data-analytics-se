    "## Definition\n",
    "Take $N$ random variables $X_1,\\dots,X_N$ and put them in a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\\dots,X_N).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that $\\mathbf{X}$ is a *random vector*.\n",
    "Random vectors are used to model *uncertain stuff* that require multiple numbers to be described.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The unobserved state of a multi-body system can be described by the random vector of coordinates and velocities.\n",
    "+ An \"uncertain function\" could be modeled by the random vector of its function values at $N$ test points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability density function of a random vector\n",
    "The the PDF of the random vector is the joint PDF of the components.\n",
    "We write:\n",

    "## Expectation of a random vector\n",
    "The expectation of a random vector is the vector of expectations of each component:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This satisfies properties similar to the expectation of scalar random variables.\n",
    "For example, for any real number $\\lambda$ we have that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda \\mathbf{X}] = \\lambda\\mathbb{E}[X].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if $\\mathbf{Y}$ is another $N$-dimensional random vector, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X+Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X] + \\mathbb{E}[Y].\n",
    "$$\n",

    "## Covariance matrix of two random vectors\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ be $N$- and $M$-dimensional random vectors, respectively.\n",
    "The covariance of $\\mathbb{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ is the $N\\times M$ matrix consisting of all covariances between the components of $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$, i.e.,\n",

    "\n",
    "It can also be rewritten as the expectation of a matrix:\n",

    "It is easy to show that the covariance is a linear function of each argument.\n",

    "The $N\\times N$ matrix $\\mathbb{C}[X,X]$ is the *self covariance* matrix (or just covariance matrix) of $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
