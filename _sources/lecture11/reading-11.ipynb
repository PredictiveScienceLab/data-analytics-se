    "# Selecting Prior Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In applications, we often find ourselves in a situation where we have to pick a probability distribution for a given variable.\n",
    "We have to pick this distribution before we see any data.\n",
    "We refer to this distribution as the *prior distribution* or simply the *prior*.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we pick a prior?\n",
    "Before we see any data, the prior should reflect our beliefs about the variable.\n",
    "But how do we express our beliefs?\n",
    "There are three widely accepted ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The *principle of insufficient reason*, also known as the *principle of indifference*. This principle tells us to assign the same probability to all possible variable values.\n",
    "+ The *principle of maximum entropy*. Given the available information, this principle tells us to pick the most \"uncertain\" distribution.\n",
    "+ The *principle of transformation groups*. This principle tells us to pick the invariant distribution under the problem's symmetries. For example, if the problem is invariant under rotations, the prior should be invariant under rotations.\n",

    "## Principle of Insufficient Reason\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of insufficient reason has its origins in Laplace. \n",
    "His original statement of the principle was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.\n",
    "*Pierre-Simon Laplace*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's restate this in simpler terms.\n",
    "Assume that the random variable $X$ can take $N$ possible values, $1, 2,\\dots, N$.\n",
    "The *principle of insufficient reason* tells us to set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\frac{1}{N},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $x$ in $\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$.\n",
    "We assign the same probability to each possible value of $X$.\n",
    "Intuitively, any other choice would introduce a bias towards one value or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Throwing a six-sided die\n",
    "Consider a six-sided die with sides numbered $1$ to $6$.\n",
    "Call $X$ the random variable corresponding to an experiment throwing the die.\n",
    "What is the probability of the die taking a specific value?\n",
    "Using the principle of insufficient reason, we set the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(X=x) = \\frac{1}{6}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You must be careful when applying the principle of insufficient reason.\n",
    "Let me give you a stupid example.\n",
    "Suppose you have a random variable $X$ that takes two values, $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "But you know that a particular process gives rise to $X$.\n",
    "The process depends on tossing a coin twice.\n",
    "If the coin comes up heads both times, then $X=1$.\n",
    "Otherwise, $X=0$.\n",
    "The principle of insufficient reason tells you that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(X=0) = p(X=1) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(X=0) = \\frac{3}{4}, \\quad p(X=1) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, knowing the number of possible values of $X$ does not suffice.\n",
    "You also need to know the meaning of $X$, and it must make intuitive sense to assign the same probability to each possible value.\n",

    "(principle-of-maximum-entropy)=\n",
    "## The Principle of Maximum Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of maximum entropy extends the principle of insufficient reason in a handy way.\n",
    "It tells you what probability distribution to assign to a random variable $X$ when you have prior information about it.\n",
    "This information could include, for example, the expected value of $X$ or its variance (see the section on *testable prior information* for a more precise description of what is allowed).\n",
    "The simplest non-mathematical definition of the principle of maximum entropy I could find is due to E. T. Jaynes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The knowledge of average values does give a reason for preferring some possibilities to others. Still, we would like [...] to assign a probability distribution which is as uniform as it can be while agreeing with the available information.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does he say, \"as uniform as it can be?\" \n",
    "He does this because he wants the principle to be consistent with the principle of insufficient reason when there is no available information.\n",
    "Of course, the uniform distribution is the most \"uncertain\" distribution, so we could also say that we are looking for a maximally uncertain distribution that agrees with the available information.\n",
    "The \"uncertainty\" of a probability distribution is measured by its \"information entropy,\" a concept we explain in the subsequent section.\n",
    "\n",
    "(information-entropy)=\n",
    "### Information entropy\n",
    "We would like to know how much uncertainty there is in a probability mass function $p(x)$.\n",
    "In 1948, [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) posed and answered this problem in his seminal paper titled \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" see {cite}`shannon`.\n",
    "The details of his derivation are beyond the scope of this course, but they can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ He looked for a functional $\\mathbb{H}[p(X)]$ that measured the uncertainty of the probability mass function $p(x)$ using real values. Note that a *functional* is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a real number.\n",
    "+ He wrote down some axioms that this functional should satisfy. For example, that should be continuous and have its maximum when $p(x)$ is uniform (because the uniform distribution has the maximum uncertainty).\n",
    "+ He did a little bit of math and proved that (up to an arbitrary multiplicative constant) the function he was looking for must have this form:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{H}[p(X)] = -\\sum_x \\log p(x) p(x).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

W. Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs)."
