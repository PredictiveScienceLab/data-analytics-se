# Lecture 23 - Bayesian Global Optimization

## Objectives
+ Recognize the challenges of optimizing expensive, potentially noisy, objective functions.
+ Explain the concept of the value of information.
+ Recognize the Bayesian global optimization algorithm.
+ Develop intuition about some acquisition functions, such as the expected improvement, the probability of improvement, and the maximum upper interval.
+ Quantify the epistemic uncertainty in the solution of an optimization problem.
