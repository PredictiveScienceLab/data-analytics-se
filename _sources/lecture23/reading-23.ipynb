    "# Bayesian Global Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss various cases of the problem of finding the global maximum of an expensive-to-evaluate function.\n",
    "We follow the so-called *Bayesian optimization* approach, a heuristic that is very popular in the machine-learning community.\n",
    "See {cite:p}`Frazier2018ATO` for more technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to address the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}^* = \\arg\\max_{\\mathbf{x}}f(\\mathbf{x}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "under the assumption that:\n",
    "+ we can evaluate $f(\\mathbf{x})$ at any $\\mathbf{x}$;\n",
    "+ evaluating $f(\\mathbf{x})$ takes a lot of time/money;\n",
    "+ we cannot evaluate the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$;\n",
    "+ the dimensionality of $\\mathbf{x}$ is not very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this an important problem?\n",
    "$\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$ may be a costly simulation that you would like to optimize under a limited budget.\n",
    "It could also be an experimentally measured quantity of interest, but you must ensure the noise is small.\n",
    "We will see what you can do when you have noise later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bayesian optimization approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization does *sequential information acquisition* for optimization.\n",
    "It is just an algorithm that tells us where to evaluate a function next if we would like to find its maximum/minimum.\n",
    "The problem can be formulated in a rigorous mathematical way using the theory and tools of dynamic programming.\n",
    "However, the full-fledged mathematical problem of designing optimal evaluation policies tends to be more complicated than the original problem of maximizing a function.\n",
    "So, we usually resort to heuristics.\n",
    "These heuristics are not optimal in a mathematical sense, but they are convenient in a practical sense.\n",
    "In a way, the heuristics balance the theoretically optimal (but computationally intractable) thing to do and randomly select evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generic heuristic, which we are going to call \"one-step-look ahead information acquisition policy,\" works as follows:\n",
    "+ We start with an initial data set consisting of $n_0$ input-output observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{D}_{n_0} = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n_0}, \\mathbf{y}_{1:n_0}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one may obtain these through Latin Hypercube Sampling of their input space.\n",
    "+ For $n=n_0,n_0+1,\\dots$, we start do the following:\n",
    "    - We use the current dataset to quantify our state of knowledge about $f(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "    For example, we can use Gaussian process regression (GPR) or any other Bayesian regression method to obtain the predictive distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        f(\\cdot) | \\mathcal{D}_{n_0} \\sim p(f(\\cdot)|\\mathcal{D}_{n_0}).\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Then we pick the *most important* point to evaluate next by looking at maximizing an *acquisition function*\n",
    "    $a_{n_0}(\\mathbf{x})$ which depends on our current state of knowledge (we will see specific examples below).\n",
    "    This acquisition function quantifies, for example, how much value or how much information there is in\n",
    "    evaluating $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "    We can assume that it is a nonnegative function.\n",
    "    So, to pick the next point, we solve a problem of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \\arg\\max a_{n}(\\mathbf{x}).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    We pick the point with the maximum value or the maximum information.\n",
    "    - If the maximum value of the acquisition function is smaller than a threshold, e.g., if $a_n(\\mathbf{x}) \\le \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, then we STOP.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, we evaluate the function at the selected $\\mathbf{x}_{n+1}$ to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    y_n = f(\\mathbf{x}_n).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This would entail either running a simulation or doing an experiment.\n",
    "    - We augment our original data set with the new observation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{D}_{n+1} = \\left((\\mathbf{x}_{1:n},\\mathbf{x}_n), (\\mathbf{y}_{1:n},y_n)\\right).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We use Bayes' rule to update our state of knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    f(\\cdot)|\\mathcal{D}_{n+1} \\sim p(f(\\cdot)|\\mathcal{D}_{n+1}) \\propto p(y_{n+1}|x_{n+1}, f(\\cdot))p(f(\\cdot)|\\mathcal{D}_{n}).\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If we have run out of evaluation budget, we STOP. Otherwise, we continue the loop.\n",
    "+ At this point, we report our current state of knowledge about the maximum of the function.\n",
    "For example, we can report what is the *observed maximum*.\n",
    "That is, we can find the index of the evaluation corresponding to the observed maximum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i^* = \\arg\\max_{1\\le i\\le n} y_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and say that the maximum was $y_{i^*}$ and the location of the maximum is $\\mathbf{x}_{i^*}$.\n",
    "Alternatively, and in particular, if our optimization budget is low, we can also quantify our epistemic uncertainty about the location of the maximum. We discuss this idea in detail towards the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide specific examples of information acquisition functions in the following sections."
