    "## Filtering problems\n",
    "Filtering problems are as follows:\n",
    "+ You have some dynamical system (physical or engineered).\n",
    "+ You observe a noisy measurement of (part of) the system's state.\n",
    "+ You want to figure out the system's actual state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of this:\n",
    "+ Object tracking:\n",
    "    - You have a vehicle (e.g., a rocket), the motion described by Newton's laws.\n",
    "    - You have noisy measurements of the system's state (e.g., GPS, accelerometers).\n",
    "    - You want to figure out where precisely the rocket is so that you can control it.\n",
    "+ Biomedical imaging:\n",
    "    - You have a blood vessel consisting of tissue and fluids that can be described with physical variables (the state) such as strains, stresses, velocity, and pressure, which are governed by physical equations (elasticity and Navier-Stokes equations).\n",
    "    - You have some noisy measurements of the system's state (e.g., acoustic Doppler shifts, average velocity in small voxels (MRI)).\n",
    "    - You want to determine the underlying physical states because they may indicate disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we are going to define the filtering problem mathematically.\n",
    "To achieve this, we first need to explain the Markov property."

    "## Markov model without external disturbances\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have a stochastic dynamical system with state variables $\\mathbf{x}_t$.\n",
    "For simplicity, assume that the time runs in discrete steps $t=0,1,2,\\dots,n$.\n",
    "If the system doesn't have any external disturbances, i.e., if the system is closed, then the following property is valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\\mathbf{x}_{0:t}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\\mathbf{x}_t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This says that the probability of the state at time $t+1$ given all the states up to the timestep $t$ depends only on the state of the system at time $t$.\n",
    "The past states before $t$ do not affect the future states directly.\n",
    "This property is the *Markov property* and $p(\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\\mathbf{x}_t)$ is called the *transition probability*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the transition probability, you can write the joint probability density of all states as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}_{0:n}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\prod_{t=0}^{n-1}p(\\mathbf{x}_{t+1}|\\mathbf{x}_t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is the probability density of the initial conditions $\\mathbf{x}_0$.\n",
    "Once you spend time on this formula, you will see why it is valid.\n",
    "The proof goes like this.\n",
    "Let's start with the special case $n=1$.\n",
    "From the product rule, we have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}_{0:1}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_0)p(\\mathbf{x}_{1}|\\mathbf{x}_{0}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the desired formula.\n",
    "For $n=2$, we have by applying the product rule again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}_{0:2}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_{0:1})p(\\mathbf{x}_2|\\mathbf{x}_{0:1}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use the formula we derived for $n=1$ and the Markov property to write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{x}_{0:2}) = p(\\mathbf{x}_0)p(\\mathbf{x}_{1}|\\mathbf{x}_{0})p(\\mathbf{x}_{2}|\\mathbf{x}_{1}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the formula holds for $n=2$.\n",
    "Similarly, you can prove this for an arbitrary $n$ if you assume it holds for $n-1$.\n",
    "Then, the proof is complete."
