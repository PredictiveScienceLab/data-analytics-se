# Lecture 10 - Quantify Uncertainty in Monte Carlo Estimates

## Objectives
+ Recognize that Monte Carlo estimates are inherently uncertain.
+ Explain the central limit theorem.
+ Demonstrate how the central limit theorem can help us quantify the epistemic uncertainty in Monte Carlo estimates.
+ Apply the Monte Carlo method to the problem of propagating uncertainty through a boundary value problem.
