# Lecture 20 - State Space Models - Kalman Filters

## Objectives
+ Use the Kalman filter to solve the filtering problem for linear models with Gaussian process and measurement noise.
+ Recognize the problem of parameter estimation in the context of filtering.
+ Use the extended Kalman filter to solve the filtering problem for nonlinear models with Gaussian process and measurement noise.
