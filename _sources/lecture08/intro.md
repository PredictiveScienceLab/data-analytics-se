# Lecture 8 - The Monte Carlo Method for Estimating Expectations

## Objectives
+ Define mathematically the uncertainty propagation problem.
+ Demonstrate the curse of dimensionality and explain why it makes the uncertainty propagation problem very hard.
+ Explain the law of large numbers which forms the basis of all sampling methods for uncertainty propagation.
+ Use the law of large numbers to estimate the variance of a quantity of interest using just samples.
