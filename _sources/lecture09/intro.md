# Lecture 9 - Monte Carlo Estimates of Various Statistics

## Objectives
+ Use the law of large numbers to estimate the cumulative distribution function of a quantity of interest from samples.
+ Use the law of large numbers to estimate the probability density of a quantity of interest from samples (histograms).
+ Use the law of large numbers to estimate predictive quantiles from samples.
+ Apply the Monte Carlo method to the problem of propagating uncertainty through an initial value problem.
