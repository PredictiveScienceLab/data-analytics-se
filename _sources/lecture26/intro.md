# Lecture 26 - Physics-informed Deep Neural Networks

## Objectives
+ Develop intuition about the potential applications of the ability to combine existing physical knowledge with data.
+ Develop intuition about the importance of symmetries in helping us learn with less data.
+ Use physics-informed neural networks to solve ordinary differential equations.
+ Use physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations.
+ Use physics-informed neural networks to solve high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations.
