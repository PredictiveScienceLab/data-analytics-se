    "# Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see Chapter 11 of {cite:p}`bishop2006`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems results in intractable posterior distributions.\n",
    "In particular, these posteriors are known only up to a normalization constant.\n",
    "In the next series of lectures, we will develop methodologies that allow us to sample from these distributions.\n",
    "The most celebrated of these methodologies is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which has at its core the Metropolis algorithms.\n",
    "There is a long way to go, but we can immediately state the problem definition and what we plan to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, let $X\\in\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ be a random variable with an arbitrary probability density, say $\\pi(x)$ known up to a normalization constant.\n",
    "That is, we have that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi(x) = \\frac{h(x)}{Z},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h(x)$ is a known function that we can evaluate at will, but $Z$ is unknown.\n",
    "We aim to generate samples from $\\pi(x)$ by only evaluating $h(x)$.\n",
    "The revolutionary idea of Metropolis was to construct a stochastic process using only $h(x)$ samples which resemble (in some way we will specify below) samples from $\\pi(x)$.\n",
    "To understand the details, we will have to introduce some key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Let $X_n, n=1,2,\\dots$ be a stochastic process taking values in $\\mathcal{X}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$, which could be discrete or continuous.\n",
    "We will refer to $n$ as the *time step*.\n",
    "We say that this stochastic process is a *Markov chain* if the evolution of $X_{n+1}$ depends only on the value of $X_n$ and not on the history of the process.\n",
    "Let us define this a little bit more rigorously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_1,\\dots,x_n\\in\\mathcal{X}$ be the observed values of the process up to $n$-th time step.\n",
    "The Markov property can now be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}|X_1=x_1,\\dots,X_n=x_n) = p(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}|X_n=x_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simplify the notation by dropping the capital letters.\n",
    "That is, we will be writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_{n+1}|x_1,\\dots,x_n) = p(x_{n+1}|x_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify things even further, we will also use the collective notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{1:n} = (x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\in\\mathcal{X}^n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation, we can re-write the Markov property in even simpler terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_{n+1}|x_{1:n}) = p(x_{n+1}|x_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The joint distribution of a Markov chain\n",
    "The *joint distribution* is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_{1:n}) := P(X_1=x_1,\\dots,X_n=x_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X_n$ is a Markov chain, then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_{1:n}) = p(x_1)p(x_2|x_1)\\dots p(x_n|x_{n-1}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_{1:n}) = p(x_1)\\prod_{t=2}^np(x_t|x_{t-1}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we know the joint distribution of a Markov chain if we know the probability of hopping from one state to the next.\n",
    "This probability is known as the transition kernel of the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Kernel\n",
    "To describe a Markov chain, we only need to know the *transition kernel*.\n",
    "The transition kernel gives the probability of moving from one state to any other at a given step.\n",
    "Mathematically, the transition kernel of the $n$-th step is the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_n:\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_+,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_n(x_n, x_{n+1}) = P(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}|X_n=x_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, $T_n(x_n, x_{n+1})$ is the probability that at step $n$ we jump from state $x_n$ to to state $x_{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the transition kernel generally depends on the time step $n$.\n",
    "We say that the Markov chain is *stationary* if the transition kernel does not depend on $n$, i.e., if\n",

    "**From now on, we will only consider stationary Markov chains.**\n",
    "For stationary Markov chains, and when there is no ambiguity, we will be writing:\n",

    "## Invariant Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X_1,X_2,\\dots$ be a Markov chain with transition kernel $T(x,x')$ and $\\pi(x)$ be a probability density.\n",
    "We say that the Markov chain leaves $\\pi(x)$ *invariant* if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi(x) = \\int \\pi(x')T(x',x)dx'.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $\\pi(x)$ is invariant if you start from a sample from it and follow the Markov chain, you get a sample from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariance is one of the key requirements of a working MCMC algorithm.\n",
    "Whatever you do, the chain you construct must be invariant with respect to the distribution from which you want to sample.\n",
    "Once you get one sample from your distribution, you can get as many as you want by following the transition kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Detailed Balance Condition\n",
    "Checking invariance is not trivial for a generic Markov chain.\n",
    "However, there is a sufficient condition that guarantees invariance.\n",
    "This condition is known as the *detailed balance condition* and it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi(x)T(x,x') = \\pi(x')T(x',x).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain that satisfies the detailed balance condition is *reversible* in the following sense.\n",
    "The probability of sampling an $x$ and transitioning to $x'$ is the same as the probability of doing the reverse.\n",

    "The reverse does not necessarily hold.\n",
    "The key idea of Metropolis was to construct a Markov chain that satisfies the detailed balance condition for the distribution you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ergodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain may have no invariant distribution (e.g., the random walk does not have an invariant distribution), one, or more than one.\n",
    "We need *ergodicity* to guarantee the invariant distribution's uniqueness.\n",
    "We need a little notation to define ergodicity precisely for continuous Markov chains.\n",
    "Ergodicity requires that the random variable $X_n$ converges in distribution to $\\pi(x)$ irrespective of the starting point.\n",
    "This is challenging to show for a generic Markov chain.\n",
    "Fortunately, we know that a Markov chain is ergodic if:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is *aperiodic* (i.e., it does not return to the same state at fixed intervals);\n",
    "+ It is *positive recurrent* (i.e., the expected number of steps for returning to the same state is finite).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equilibrium Distribution\n",
    "If a Markov chain is ergodic and has an invariant distribution, then that invariant distribution is unique and called the *equilibrium distribution*.\n",
