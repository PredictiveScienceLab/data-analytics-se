    "For the binary classification case, we are looking at $\\ell(\\hat{y},y)$ is just a $2\\times 2$ matrix (two possibilities for $\\hat{y}$ and two possibilities for $y$).\n",
    "Once you have your loss function, the rational thing to do is to pick the $\\hat{y}$ that minimizes your *expected loss*.\n",
    "The expectation is over what you think the true value of $y$ is.\n",
