    "# Gaussian Process Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We attempt to understand a Gaussian process and how it can be used to define a prior probability measure on the space of functions.\n",
    "The complete mathematical details are in Chapter 1 of {cite:p}`10.7551/mitpress/3206.001.0001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation: A fully Bayesian paradigm for curve fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian process regression is Bayesian regression on steroids.\n",
    "However, understanding how it works requires a change of mind.\n",
    "After a bit of practice, it starts making sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Let's say that you have to learn some function $f(\\cdot)$ from some space $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ (this could either be a supervised learning problem (regression or classification) or even an unsupervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ You sit down and you think about $f(\\cdot)$. What do you know about it? How large do you expect it to be? How small do you expect it to be? Is it continuous? Is it differentiable? Is it periodic? How fast does it change as you change its inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ You create a probability measure on the space of functions in which $f(\\cdot)$ lives, which is compatible with everything you know. Abusing mathematical notation a lot, let's write this probability measure as $p(f(\\cdot))$. Now you can sample from it. Any sample you take is compatible with your prior beliefs. You cannot tell which one is better than any other. They could be the true $f(\\cdot)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Then, you get some data, say $\\mathcal{D}$. You model the likelihood of the data, $p(\\mathcal{D}|f(\\cdot))$, i.e., you model how the data may have been generated if you knew $f(\\cdot)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Finally, you use Bayes' rule to come up with your posterior probability measure over the space of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(f(\\cdot)|\\mathcal{D}) \\propto p(\\mathcal{D}|f(\\cdot)) p(f(\\cdot)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is simultaneously compatible with your prior beliefs and the data.\n",
    "Again, we are abusing mathematical notation here since you cannot write down the probability density corresponding to a random function.\n",
    "But you get the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Persi Diaconis' said in {cite:p}`Diaconis1988BayesianNA`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most people, even Bayesians, think that this sounds crazy when they first hear about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do Gaussian processes come in?\n",
    "Well, it is just the equivalent of the multivariate Gaussian for function spaces.\n",
    "It defines a probability measure on the function space centered about a mean (function) and shaped by a covariance (function).\n",
    "In this lecture, we will show that the mean and covariance functions are where you can encode your prior knowledge.\n",
    "We will also show how you can sample functions from this probability measure.\n",
    "Next time, we will show how to condition these probability measures on observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some mathematical terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "A *stochastic process* is just a collection of random variables that are labeled by some index: $\\{X_i\\}$ for some $i$ in a set $I$.\n",
    "If the set $I$ is discrete, we say we have a discrete stochastic process.\n",
    "We have a continuous stochastic process if the set $I$ is continuous.\n",
    "We will primarily work with continuous stochastic processes in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $X_t = X(t)$ is a stochastic process parameterized by time.\n",
    "You can also think of a stochastic process as a random function.\n",
    "Here is how you sample an $\\omega$: you keep it fixed, and then $X(t,\\omega)$ is just a function of time. (Remember what we learned in earlier lectures: a random variable is just a function from the event space to the real numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can have a stochastic process parameterized by space. For example, $T(x,\\omega)$ could be an unknown temperature field.\n",
    "This is typically called a random field.\n",
    "You can also have a stochastic process parameterized by space and time, say $T(x,t,\\omega)$.\n",
    "This is an unknown spatiotemporal temperature field.\n",
    "You can have a stochastic process parameterized by any continuous label you like.\n",
    "It does not have to be space or time.\n",
    "Also, you can have as many different labels as you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian processes are the simplest continuous stochastic processes you can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian process\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian process (GP) is a generalization of a multivariate Gaussian distribution to\n",
    "*infinite* dimensions.\n",
    "It defines a probability measure on a function space.\n",
    "When we say that $f(\\cdot)$ is a GP, we mean that it is a random variable that is \n",
    "a function.\n",
    "Mathematically, we write:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(\\cdot) \\sim \\text{GP}\\left(m(\\cdot), k(\\cdot, \\cdot) \\right),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where \n",
    "$m:\\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the *mean function* and \n",
    "$k:\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the *covariance function*.\n",
    "So, compared to a multivariate normal, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A random function $f(\\cdot)$ instead of a random vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "+ A mean function $m(\\cdot)$ instead of a mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n",
    "+ A covariance function $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ instead of a covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does this definition mean? It gets its meaning from the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Here is how: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Let $\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}=\\{\\mathbf{x}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_n\\}$ be $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "+ Let $\\mathbf{f}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ be the outputs of $f(\\cdot)$ on each one of the elements of $\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}$, i.e.,\n",
